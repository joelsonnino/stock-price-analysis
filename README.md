# stock-price-analysis
Project Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of stock prices using REST APIs and data manipulation techniques. The primary goal is to explore the historical stock price data of three companies, calculate moving averages, analyze correlations, and identify trends over a specific period.

Objectives:
- Visualize the stock price evolution of the selected companies.
- Calculate the 5-day and 10-day moving averages of a stockâ€™s closing price.
- Plot the results of the moving averages.
- Analyze the correlation between the stocks for the year 2024.
- Classify days as bullish or bearish based on daily returns.

Dataset Utilized:
The data is retrieved using the Financial Modeling Prep API. Historical stock price data is fetched for the following companies:
- Apple Inc. (AAPL)
- General Electric (GE)
- General Motors (GM)

Tools and Libraries:
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- requests
- json

How to Run the Project
- Install the necessary libraries using pip:
- pip install pandas matplotlib requests

Run the Jupyter Notebook to fetch and analyze the stock data. The data is saved in JSON format for each company.

Execute the code cells sequentially to reproduce the visualizations and analyses.

Results:
- The project successfully visualizes the stock price evolution for the selected companies.
- The moving averages provide insights into the stock trends over short-term and medium-term periods.
- Correlation analysis helps in understanding the relationship between the stock movements of the different companies.
- Classification of days as bullish or bearish based on daily returns gives an overview of market sentiment.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of REST APIs and data manipulation in financial data analysis. It provides a solid foundation for further exploration in the field of quantitative finance.
